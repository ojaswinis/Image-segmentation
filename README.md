# Image-segmentation
Used K-means clustering to compress the size of images by clustering them using RGB values of 
pixels. An average reduction of 6.25x was recorded without significant drop in image quality. 
Created a web app using HTML,CSS, Javascript and Flask for deployment.
This was a personal project for Learning and Skill Demonstration.
I welcome all commits to further enhance image compression without a significant drop in image quality
